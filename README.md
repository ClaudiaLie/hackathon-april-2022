## Introduction

With climate change becoming a increasing urgent problem in our lives, [vehicle numbers globally now at an estimated 1.446 billion](https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2021/06/how-many-cars-are-there-in-the-world/) and [80% of lung diseases being caused by car pollution](https://study.com/academy/lesson/car-pollution-facts-lesson-for-kids.html#:~:text=Car%20engines%20release%20poisonous%20gases,a%20result%20of%20car%20pollution.) there is a no better time to start looking for more eco-friedly vehicles for the planets health and our own. Electic Vehicles (EVs) and Hybrid Vehicles are improving rapidly and if more people moved to the alternatives then maufactures would be motivated to put more money and emphasis into development of these vehicles. With [One-fifth of Europe's greenhouse gases coming from the transportation sector alone](https://www.virta.global/blog/electric-cars-pollution-facts), this is a massive market which could play a major part in our planets future.


To help educate and encourage the everyday motorist to consider moving to an alternativly fueled vehicle, we have created a website that easily provides the user with more eco-friendly alternatives to the type of vehicle they are looking for. The website also provides more information about the problems and threats caused by ICEs and what the benefits of making a change could be, for the enviroment and the motorist.

This project has been build as part of Code Institutes Earth Day Hackathon Event April 2022 by TEAM_4.

## UX

### **Project Goals**

### **Business Goals**

### **User Demographic**

### **Value for the User**

- Learn more about the issues caused by using traditional fuel types and the benefits of alternatives
- Easily find vehicles that use alternative power sources that I am interested in and would suit the users needs
- Calculate possible savings by moving to an alternative fuel
- Easily find retailers that have a chosen vehicle available for purchase
